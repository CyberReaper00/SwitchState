# Overview
I have created a simple config of slock in which it has transparency, an alternate color on input and i have created a mesh that says LOCKED on the screen when slock is activated

**Patches**
- dwmlogo
	- This was used to draw out the LOCKED message on slock
- alpha
	- This was used to give slock 40% transparency along with picom
